I observed in my college that if students have any problem or they
want to give suggestions to college administration, they have to 
write it on paper and drop it in suggestion boxes around campus.
I just converted this process into an online portal to ease the 
process, used Node and Express for the backend, HTML, CSS, Bootstrap
for front end,  MongoDB Atlas for database and hosted it on Heroku.
